# TheSportsApp
Technical Challenge iOS

Go to https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php and explore the endpoints available there.
It is recommended to make application flowchart and comment the code.

**Develop an iOS app with the following instructions:**
1. Create a launch screen that introduces your app.

2. In the main view, make a layout that gives the possibility to choose a league among the 
all that are available in the API.

3. When choosing a league, all the teams that compose it will be displayed in a list with
the following data inherent to each team:

● Team name
● Stadium name
● Year of foundation of the team
● Team logo

4. Selecting a team will display additional team information (what you want) with the 
possibility of returning to the view where the list of all the teams is of the selected 
league and choose a different one.

**Clarifications**
● The design of the application as well as its components is free choice, it will be held
into account your ability to present the information in each case.

**Extra points**
● Use of the UIKit framework
● MVC architecture pattern
● Creating a filter to search for computers by name
● Use of Git during the project (commits will be reviewed)
● Any added value you want to add to the project

To evaluate the efficiency of your application, it will be taken into account to what extent
it manages to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, its good programming practices and
how it improves what it has been proposed to do.
